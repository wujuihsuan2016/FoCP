% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{First-order Combinatorial Proofs}
\subsection{First-order Logic and Graphs}

\bfit{Terms} $s, t, u, \ldots$ and \bfit{atoms} (atomic formulas) $\alpha, \beta,
\gamma, \ldots$ are generated inductively from variables $x, y, z, \ldots$: if
$\delta$ (resp. $p$) is an $n$-ary function (resp. predicate) symbol and $t_1, \ldots,
t_n$ are terms, then $\delta t_1 \ldots t_n$ (resp. $pt_1 \ldots t_n$) is a term
(resp. atom). The set of atoms is extended with logical constant $\ttt$ and
$\fff$. We also assume that each predicate symbol $p$ has a \bfit{dual}
predicate symbol $\overline{p}$ with $\overline{p} \neq p$ and
$\overline{\overline{p}} = p$. We extend the duality to atoms with
$\overline{pt_1 \ldots t_n} = \overline{p}t_1 \ldots t_n$, $\overline{\ttt} =
\fff$, and $\overline{\fff} = \ttt$. \bfit{Formulas} $A, B, C$ are generated inductively from atoms by binary
connectives $\vee$ and $\wedge$ and quantifiers $\forall x$ and $\exists x$.
The \bfit{negation} $\neg$ is defined in the usual way. A formula is \bfit{rectified} if all bound variables are distinct from one another and from all free variables. Without loss of generality, we assume that all formulas are rectifed throughtout the paper as every formula has a logically equivalent rectified form.

A \bfit{directed graph} $G = (V, E)$ consists of a finite set $V$ of
\bfit{vertices} and a set of $E \subseteq V \times V$ of \bfit{direct edges}. An
\bfit{undirected graph} $G = (V, E)$ consists of a finite set $V$ of vertices
and a set of $E$ of \bfit{undirected edges} (two-element subsets of $V$).
For a given (directed or undirected) graph $G$, we write $V_G$ and $E_G$ for its
vertex and edge sets respectively. We write $vw$ for an edge $(v, w)$ or $\{v,
w\}$. Let $G = (V, E)$ and $G' = (V', E')$ be two undirected graphs. Without
loss of generality, we assume that $V$ and $V'$ are disjoint. The \bfit{union}
$G + G'$ is the graph $(V \cup V', E \cup E')$ and the \bfit{join} $G \times G'$
is the graph $(V \cup V', E \cup E' \cup \{vv' | v \in V, v' \in V'\})$. A
\bfit{cograph} is a $P_4$-free undireced grpah, i.e., for any distinct vertices $v_1,
v_2, v_3, v_4 \in V$, the restriction of the edge sets on them is not equal to
$\{v_1v_2, v_2v_3, v_3v_4\}$. In a graph $G = (V, E)$, the \bfit{neighbourhood}
$N(v)$ of $v \in V$ is defined as the set $\{w | vw \in E\}$, a set $W \subseteq
V$ induces a \bfit{matching} if for all $w \in W$, $N(w) \cap E$ is a singleton, and a module is a
set $M \subseteq V$ such that $N(v) \ M = N(w) \ M$ for all $v, w \in M$. A
\bfit{module} $M$ is strong if for every module $M'$, we have $M' \subseteq M$, $M
\subseteq$ or $M \cap M' = \emptyset$. A \bfit{graph homomorphism} $f: (V, E)
\rightarrow (V', E')$ is a function $f : V \rightarrow V'$ such that $f(v)f(w)
\in E'$ whenever $vw \in E$.

\subsection{First-order combinatorial proofs}
A cograph is \bfit{logical} if every vertex is labelled either by an atom or variable,
and it has at least one atom-labelled vertex. We denote by $label_G(v)$, or simply
$label(v)$ the label of a vertex in a logical cograph $G$. An atom-labelled vertex is called
a \bfit{literal} and a variable-labelled vertex is called a \bfit{binder}. A
binder labelled with $x$ is called an \bfit{$x$-binder}. The \bfit{scope} of a binder
$b$ is the smallest strong module containing at least two vertices, including
the binder itself. An \bfit{$x$-literal} is a literal whose atom contains the variable $x$. An $x$-binder \bfit{binds} every $x$-literal in its scope.
In a logical cograph $G$, a binder $b$ is \bfit{existential} (resp. \bfit{universal}) if, for every other
vertex $v$ in its scope, we have $bv \in E_G$ (resp. $bv \notin E_G$). An
$x$-binder is \bfit{legal} if its scope contains no other $x$-binder and at least one
literal. 

We now introduce first-order graphs which are used to represent first-order formulas.

\begin{definition}
A \bfit{first-order graph} or \bfit{fograph} is a logical cograph with legal binders.
\end{definition}

For a formula $A$, we can define its associated fograph $\Gr(A)$ inductively by: $\Gr(\alpha) = \cdot \alpha$ (a single-vertex graph whose vertex is labelled by $\alpha$); $\Gr(A \vee B) = \Gr(A) + \Gr(B)$ and $\Gr(A \wedge B) = \Gr(A) \times \Gr(B)$.
The \bfit{binding graph} of a forgraph $G$ is the directed graph $(V_G, \{(b,
l) | b \text{ binds } l\})$.

In a fograph, two atoms are \bfit{pre-dual} if their predicate symbols are dual
(e.g. $pxy$ and $\overline{p}yz$) and two literals are \bfit{pre-dual} if their
labels (atoms) are pre-dual. A \bfit{linked fograph} is a coloured fograph such
that every colour, called a \bfit{link}, consists of two pre-dual literals, and
every literal is either $\ttt$-labelled or in a link.

Let $G$ be a linked fograph. The set of links can be seen as a unification problem
by identifying dual predicate symbols. A \bfit{dualizer} of $G$ is an assignment
unifying all the links of $G$. Since a first-order unification problem is either
solvable or has a most general unifier, we can define the notion of \bfit{most
general dualizer}. A \bfit{dependency} is a pair $(\cdot x, \cdot y)$ of an
existential binder $\cdot x$ and a universal binder $\cdot y$ such that the most
general dualizer assigns to $x$ a term containing $y$. A \bfit{leap} is either a
link or a dependency. The \bfit{leap graph} $\LG_G$ of $G$ is the undirected graph $(V_G,
L_G)$ where $L_G$ is the set of leaps of $G$. A set $W \subseteq V_G$ induces a
\bfit{bimatching} in $G$ if $W$ induces a matching in $G$ and in the leap graph
$\LG_G$ as well.

\begin{definition}
A \bfit{first-order net} or \bfit{fonet} is a linked fograph which has
dualizer but no induced bimatching.  
\end{definition}

A graph homomorphism $f: (V, E) \rightarrow (V', E')$ is a \bfit{fibration} if
for all $v \in V$ and $wf(v) \in E'$, there exists a unique $\tilde{w}$ such
that $\tilde{w}v \in E$ and $f(\tilde{w}) = w$, and is a \bfit{skew fibration}
if for all $v \in V$ and $wf(v) \in E'$ there exists $\tilde{w}$ such that
$\tilde{w}v \in E$ and $f(\tilde{w})w \notin E'$. A \bfit{fograph homomorphism}
is a graph homomorphism between the underlying graphs of the fographs
considered. A fograph homomorphism $f : G \rightarrow G'$ is
\bfit{label-preserving} if forall $v \in V_G, label(v) = label(f(v))$, and is
\bfit{existential-preserving} if for all existental binder $b$ in $G$, the
vertex $f(b)$ is an existential binder in $G'$.

\begin{definition}
A \bfit{skew bifibration} between fographs is a label-preserving and
	existential-preserving fograph homomorphism whose restriction to the
	binding graphs is a fibration.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \bfit{first-order combinatorial proof} of a fograph $G$ is a skew
bifibration $f: N \rightarrow G$ where $N$ is a fonet. A \bfit{first-order
combinatorial proof} of a formula $A$ is a combinatorial proof of its graph
	$\Gr(A)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{$\FOMLL$ and Unification Nets}

In $\FOMLL$, terms, atoms, formulas are defined as in first-order logic. For
simplicity, we choose to use $\vee$ and $\wedge$ instead of $\parr$ and
$\otimes$ which are generally used in the presentation of linear logic.
A formula $A$ is identified with its \bfit{formula tree} $\FT(A)$, a directed
tree with leaves labelled by atoms, internal nodes labelled by connectives and
quantifiers, and edges directed from leaves to the root. A \bfit{sequent} $\Gamma$ is simply a disjoint union of formulas. We write
comma for disjoint union.

Sequents are proved using the inference rules of $\FOMLL$:
\begin{center}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \infer0[$\ax$]{\vdash A, \neg A}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \hypo{\vdash \Delta, \neg A}
  \infer2[$\cut$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \hypo{\vdash \Delta, B}
  \infer2[$\conj$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta, A \wedge B}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{1.5cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, B}
  \infer1[$\disj$]{\vdash \Gamma, A \vee B}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \infer1[$\univ$]{\vdash \Gamma, \forall x A}
\end{prooftree}
($x \notin fv(\Gamma)$)
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A[t/x]}
  \infer1[$\exist$]{\vdash \Gamma, \exists x A}
\end{prooftree}}
\end{center}

We also consider the $\mix$ rule:

\begin{center}
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
\hypo{\vdash \Delta}
\infer2[$\mix$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta}
\end{prooftree}
\end{center}

Let $\Gamma$ be a sequent in $\FOMLLm$. A \bfit{link} on $\Gamma$ is a pair of
leaves whose atoms are pre-dual. A \bfit{linking} on $\Gamma$ is a set of 
disjoint links such that each leaf of $\Gamma$ is in exacly one link. Similar
to the set of links in the linked fograph, a linking can be seen as a
unification problem, and a link is said \bfit{unifiable} if the corresponding
unification problem is solvable. \bfit{Dependencies} are defined as previously.

Let $\lambda$ is a unifiable linking on $\Gamma = A_1, \ldots, A_n$.
Let $A = A_1 \vee \ldots \vee A_n$. The \bfit{unification structure}
$\US(\lambda)$
associated to $\lambda$ is the formula tree $\FT(A)$ together with an undirected
edge between leaves $l$ and $l'$ for every link $\{l, l'\}$ in $\lambda$ and a
directed edge from $\exists x$ to $\forall y$ for every dependency $\exists x
\rightarrow \forall y$.

A \bfit{switching graph} of a unification structure $\US(\lambda)$ is any
derivative of $\US(\lambda)$ obtained by keeping only one edge into each $\parr$
and $\forall$ and undirecting remaining edges. A linking is \bfit{correct} if it
is unifiable and all of the switching graphs of its associated unification
structure are acyclic.

\begin{definition}
  A \bfit{unification net} on a sequent $\Gamma$ is a correct linking on $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Deep Inference}
In this paper we also use some \bfit{deep inference} \cite{BT 2001} rules that are in the
following form:
\begin{center}
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{A\}}
  \infer1[]{\vdash S\{B\}}
\end{prooftree}
\end{center}
where $S\{ \ \}$ stands for a \bfit{context}, which corresponds to a sequent
with a hole taking the place of an atom, and $S\{A\}$ represents
the sequent or formula obtained by replacing the hole in $S\{ \ \}$ with the formula $A$. Formally, 

  \[C ::= \Box \ | \ A \vee C \ | \ C \wedge A \ | \ \exists x C \ | \ \forall x C \].
  \[S ::= C \ | \ A, S \ | \ S, A \] where $A$ is a formula.
The above rule can be thus seen as the rewriting rule $A \rightarrow B$.

We use the notation $\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\mathcal{P}}{B}{\vlhy {A}}}$ for denoting that there is a derivation from premise $\vdash S\{A\}$ to conclusion $\vdash S\{B\}$ in system $P$ for any context $S$.

\section{From first-order logic to combinatorial proofs}

\subsection{$\LK$}
We start with Gentzen's sequent calculus system $\LK$ \cite{Gentzen 1935}.

\begin{center}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \infer0[$ax$]{\vdash A, \neg A}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \hypo{\vdash \Delta, \neg A}
  \infer2[$cut$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \hypo{\vdash \Delta, B}
  \infer2[$\wedge$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta, A \wedge B}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{1.5cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, B}
  \infer1[$\vee$]{\vdash \Gamma, A \vee B}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, A}
  \infer1[$ctr$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}
	\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
  \infer1[$wk$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
\infer0[$\ttt$]{\vdash \ttt}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
	\infer1[$\fff$]{\vdash \Gamma, \fff}
\end{prooftree}}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A}
  \infer1[$\forall$]{\vdash \Gamma, \forall x A}
\end{prooftree}
($x \notin fv(\Gamma)$)
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A[t/x]}
  \infer1[$\exists$]{\vdash \Gamma, \exists x A}
\end{prooftree}}

\end{center}

We also consider the mix rule here:

\begin{center}
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
\hypo{\vdash \Delta}
\infer2[$mix$]{\vdash \Gamma, \Delta}
\end{prooftree}
\end{center}

Note that the mix rule is derivable via weakening in $\LK$.

Consider the following deep rules \cite{BT 2001}:
\begin{center}
\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{A \vee A\}}
  \infer1[$\cD$]{\vdash S\{A\}}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{2cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{\fff \}}
  \infer1[$\wD$]{\vdash S\{A\}}
\end{prooftree}
}
\end{center}

Note that the $ctr$ (resp. $wk$) rule in $\LK$ is derivable in $\{\cD, \vee\}$
(resp. $\{\wD, \fff\}$) and that $\cD$ and $\wD$ rules
permute downwards with the non-structural rules of $\LK$. 

\begin{center}
\mbox{

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, A}
  \infer1[$ctr$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

$\ \leadsto \ $

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, A}
  \infer1[$\vee$]{\vdash \Gamma, A \vee A}
  \infer1[$\cD$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
  \infer1[$wk$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

$\ \leadsto \ $

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
  \infer1[$\fff$]{\vdash \Gamma, \fff}
  \infer1[$\wD$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}}

\end{center}

We also give an example to show how rule permutation works:

\begin{center}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\Gamma,A \vee A}
\infer1[$\cD$]{\Gamma,A} 
\hypo{\Delta,B}
\infer2[$\wedge$]{\Gamma, \Delta, A \wedge B} 
\end{prooftree}

$\ \leadsto \ $

\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\Gamma,A \vee A}
\hypo{\Delta,B}
\infer2[$\wedge$]{\Gamma, \Delta, (A \vee A) \wedge B} 
\infer1[$\cD$]{\Gamma, \Delta, A \wedge B} 
\end{prooftree}}

\end{center}

We want to establish the following theorem:

\begin{theorem_}
\label{thm1}
Let $\Gamma$ be a sequent. Then there is a proof of $\Pi$ in $\LKm$ iff there is a proof of some sequent $\Delta$ in $\FOMLLm$ and a derivation from $\Delta$ to $\Gamma$ consisting of the $\cD$ and $\wD$ rules only. 
\end{theorem_}

\begin{proof}
($\Rightarrow$) This direction comes from the above observation: it suffices to permute downwards all the instances of the $\cD$ and $\wD$ rules.

($\Leftarrow$)
We regard the proof in $\FOMLLm$ as a proof in $\LKm$.
Then we put the derivation consisting of only $\cD$ and $\wD$ under the proof in $\LKm$. Now we try to permute all the instances $\cD$ and $\wD$ upwards with the rules of LK and $mix$. 
For the $\cD$ part, the only non-trivial case is the permutation with the $\vee$ rule where the formula generated is $A \vee A$.

\begin{center}
\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, A}
\infer1[$\vee$]{\vdash \Gamma, A \vee A}
\infer1[$\cD$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

$\ \leadsto \ $

\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma, A, A}
\infer1[$ctr$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

} 
\end{center}

In this case, the permutation of this instance of $\cD$ stops and we continue with the remaining instances.

For the $\wD$ part, the only non-trivial case is the permutation with the $\fff$ rule (or the instance of $wk$ where $\fff$ is introduced):

\begin{center}
\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
\infer1[$\fff$]{\vdash \Gamma, f}
\infer1[$\wD$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

$\ \leadsto \ $

\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\vdash \Gamma}
\infer1[$wk$]{\vdash \Gamma, A}
\end{prooftree}

} 
\end{center}

In this case, the permutation of this instance of $\wD$ stops and we continue with the remaining instances.

\end{proof}

D. Hughes proves in \cite{Hughes 2019} the soundness and completeness of
unification nets with respect to $\FOMLLm$. In the following, we establish the
equivalence between unification nets and fonets.

\subsection{Equivalence between unification nets and fonets}
In the following, we usually confound a vertex with its label. 

We also confound $\parr$ with $\vee$ and $\otimes$ with $\wedge$ as unification
nets and first-order nets (fonets) are defined in different contexts.

\begin{definition} A \textit{switching path} of a unification structure $U(\lambda)$ is a path in a switching graph of $U(\lambda)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textit{switching path} of a  formula tree $\FT(A)$ is a
	path in $\FT(A)$ that does not go through both incoming edges of a $\parr$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop1}
In a formula tree, the root is connected to every vertex by a switching path.
\end{proposition}

Now we give the key proposition relating a fograph to its corresponding formula
tree.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop2}
Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct vertices of a fograph $\Gr(A)$, then we have the equivalence
between:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $\Gr(A)$
  \item $u$ and $v$ are connected by a switching path of $F(A)$, and if one of them is a universal quantifier, then the other is
	not a descendant of the former.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{proof}
By induction on $A$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If $A$ is an atom, trivial.
  \item If $A = A_1 \wedge A_2$, then we distinguish two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $u$ and $v$ are both in $A_1$ (resp. $A_2$): trivial by
	      the induction hypothesis.
      \item one of them is in $A_1$ and the other is in $A_2$: they are
	      adjacent in $\Gr(A)$ by definition. By Proposition \ref{prop1},
		    the one in $A_1$ (resp. $A_2$) is connected to the
		    vertex representing $A_1$ (resp. $A_2$) by a switching
		    path. Together with the two edges incident to $A_1 \wedge
		    A_2$, we obtain a switching path connecting $u$ and $v$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item If $A = A_1 \vee A_2$, then we distinguish two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $u$ and $v$ are both in $A_1$ (resp. $A_2$): trivial by
	      the induction hypothesis.
      \item one of them is in $A_1$ and the other is in $A_2$: they are not
	      adjacent in $\Gr(A)$ by definition. It is clear that they
		    are not connected by a switching path.
    \end{itemize}
  \item If $A = \exists x \ A'$, then we distinguish two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $u$ and $v$ are both in $A'$: trivial by the induction
	      hypothesis.
      \item one of them is $\exists x$ and the other is in $A'$: trivial
	      by Proposition \ref{prop1}

    \end{itemize}
  \item If $A = \forall x \ A'$, then we distinguish two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $u$ and $v$ are both in $A'$: trivial by the induction
	      hypothesis.
      \item one of them is $\forall x$ and the other is in $A'$:
	      they are not adjacent in $\Gr(A)$ by definition and it is clear that
		    the former is a descendant of $\forall x$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
If there exists an induced bimatching of the linked fograph $G = \Gr(A)$, then there exists a switching graph of the corresponding unification net which contains a cycle.
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that there exists a set $W$ inducing a bimatching in $G$.
  Then $(W, E_G)$ and $(W, L_G)$ are matchings.\\
  Let $E_W$ (resp. $L_W$) be the restriction of $E_G$ (resp. $L_G$) to $W$. \\
  If $E_W \cap L_W \neq \emptyset$, then there exist $u$ and $v$ such that $uv
  \in E_G$ and $uv \in L_G$. By Proposition \ref{prop2}, there exists a
  switching path of the formula tree of $A$. Together with the leap
  $uv$, this path induces a cycle in a switching graph of the
  corresponding unification structure. \\
  We can now suppose that $E_W$ and $L_W$ are disjoint. It is not difficult to
  see the existence of an alternating and elementary cycle in the bicoloured graph $(W, E_W \uplus L_W)$, i.e. a cycle of which the edges are alternately in $E_W$ and $L_W$ and containing no two equal vertices.
  By Proposition \ref{prop2}, this cycle induces a cycle in the unification
  structure. Now we want to construct a switching graph that contains this cycle.\\
  Consider a universal quantifier $\forall x$. If $\forall x \notin W$, then        
  we keep the incoming edge from its direct subformula and remove all the 
  dependencies. Otherwise, since $(W, L_G)$ is a matching, there exists a
  unique existential quantifier adjacent to $\forall x$ and we keep thus the
  corresponding edge in the unification structure. \\
  Now consider a $\parr$. We distinguish three cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the cycle goes through none of the two branches (incoming edges) of
	    the $\parr$: we can choose an
	    arbitrary switching for this $\parr$
    \item the cycle goes through exactly one branch: we choose the corresponding
	    switching
    \item the cycle goes through both branches:
	    this means that there exist $v_L \in W$ (resp. $v_R$) in the left
		  (resp. right) branch, $u_L$, $u_R \in W$, such that
		  $u_Lv_L, u_Rv_R \in E_W$ and that the corresponding switching path from $u_L$ to $v_L$ (resp. from $u_R$ to $v_R$) goes through the left (resp. right) edge of $\parr$.

    {\bf Figure 7.} A schema showing that the two branches of the same $\parr$ cannot be used in the cycle at the same time. 
    \end{center}
    
    The red (resp. blue) path is the switching path corresponding to the edge $u_Lv_L$ (resp. $u_Rv_R$) in $E_W$.  
    
    It is clear that $u_L$ (resp. $u_R$) is not in the branches of the
	 $\parr$. Otherwise, there will be no switching path from $u_L$ to $v_L$ 

    By Proposition \ref{prop2}, we know that $u_L$ and $u_R$ are not
	universal quantifiers which are ancestors the $\parr$
	and that there exist one switching path from $u_L$ to $v_L$ and one
	from $u_R$ to $v_R$. In particular, there exist one switching path from
	$u_L$ to the $\parr$ and one from the $\parr$ to $v_R$, and by
	concatenating the two, we obtain a switching path from $u_L$ to $v_R$. 
	By Proposition \ref{prop2}, $u_L$ and $v_R$ are thus adjacent in $(W,
	E_G)$, which is impossible since $(W, E_W)$ is a matching.
  \end{itemize}
  Notice that the switching paths here are in the underlying formula tree. We
  have to verify that they are compatible with the choices of switching made for
  universal quantifiers. That is, if $uv \in E_W$, then for all the
  universal quantifiers $\forall x$ on the switching path (in the formula
	tree), we have chosen in the first part of the proof to keep the only
	edge from the child of $\forall x$ to itself. In fact, if there exists
	a universal quantifier $w \in W$ on the switching path $u \rightarrow
	v$, then one of $u$ and $v$ is not a descendant of $w$. Moreover, if
	$u$ (resp. $v$) is a universal quantifier, then $w$ is not in its scope.
	By Proposition \ref{prop2}, $\{wu, wv\} \cap E_W \neq \emptyset$, which
	is impossible since $(W, E_W)$ is a matching.
  We have thus constructed a switching graph containing this cycle.
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
If one of the switching graphs of the unification structure of $A$
contains a cycle or is not connected, then there exists an induced bimatching of the
corresponding linked fograph.
\begin{proof}
We use frames introduced by D. Hughes in Section 4 of \cite{Hughes 2015}.

\begin{definition}
Let $\theta$ be a unification structure on an $\FOMLL$ sequent $\Gamma$.
We define the \textit{frame}  of $\theta$ by exhaustively applying the following subformula rewriting steps, to obtain a proof structure $\theta_m$ on an $\MLL$ sequent $\Gamma_m$:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Encode dependencies as fresh links.} For each dependency $\exists x \rightarrow \forall y$, with corresponding subformulas $\exists x A$ and $\forall y B$, we add a fresh link as follows. Let $P$ be a fresh (nullary) predicate symbol. Replace $\exists x A$ with $P \otimes \exists x A$ and $\forall y B$ with $\overline{P} \parr \forall y B$, and add an axiom link between $P$ and $\overline{P}$.
  \item {\bf Erase quantifiers.} After step 1, erase all the quantifiers. (We no longer need their leaps since they are encoded as links in step 1.
  \item {\bf Simplify atoms.} After step 2, replace every predicate $Pt_1 \cdots t_n$ with a nullary predicate symbol $P$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

{\bf Figure 8.} A unification net and its frame. The colored part shows how the dependency ${\color{red} \exists x} \rightarrow {\color{blue} \forall z}$ is transformed.
\end{center}

We have the following results: 

Let $u$ and $v$ be atoms or quantifiers in a unification structure $\theta$. Then they are connected by a switching path in the unification structure if, and only if, their corresponding nodes are connected by a switching path in $\theta_m$.

Consider now a switching graph $H$ of a unification structure $\theta$ of $A$.

If $H$ contains a cycle, then the corresponding switching graph of $\theta_m$ also contains a cycle. Hence, by applying the propositional results (Theorem 7) from \cite{Retore 2003}, we conclude that there exists a chordless, alternating, and elementary cycle in the bicoloured graph ($W, E_W \uplus L_W$), which corresponds to an induced bimatching in the linked fograph. (Note that the linked fograph (cograph) corresponding to $\theta_m$ is equivalent to the one corresponding to $\theta$.)

\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{From contraction/weakening to skew bifibrations}

We first introduce the atomic contraction rule, the medial rule, and two rules
on quantifiers.

\begin{center}
\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{a \vee a\}}
  \infer1[$\acD$]{\vdash S\{a\}}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{0.3cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{(A \wedge B) \vee (C \wedge D)\}}
  \infer1[$\me$]{\vdash S\{(A \vee C) \wedge (B \vee D)\}}
\end{prooftree}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{\exists x A \vee \exists x B\}}
  \infer1[$\mee$]{\vdash S\{\exists x (A \vee B)\}}
\end{prooftree}	
\hspace{0.3cm}

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{\forall x A \vee \forall x B\}}
  \infer1[$\meee$]{\vdash S\{\forall x (A \vee B)\}}
\end{prooftree}	
}
\end{center}

Here, we also consider the equivalence generated by the associativity, commutativity of $\vee$ and the equations $\ttt \vee A \equiv \ttt$ and $\fff \vee A \equiv A$.

Now we have the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma_ctr}
The contraction rule $\cD$ is derivable for $\{\acD, \me, \mee, \meee\}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We prove that there is always $\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\{\acD, \me, \mee,
	\meee\}}{A}{\vlhy {A \vee A}}}$ by structural induction on $A$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If $A = \ttt$ or $A = \fff$, we have 
	  \begin{prooftree} 
	    \hypo{\vdash S\{A \vee A\}}
	    \infer1[$\equiv$]{\vdash S\{A\}}
	  \end{prooftree}. (the premiss and the conclusion are equivalent)
  \item If $A = a$, then we have 
	  \begin{prooftree}
	    \hypo{\vdash S\{a \vee a\}}
	    \infer1[$\acD$]{\vdash S\{a\}}.
	  \end{prooftree}
  \item If $A = A_1 \vee A_2$, then by the induction hypothesis, we have 
	  $\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\{\acD, \me, \mee,
	\meee\}}{A_i}{\vlhy {A_i \vee A_i}}}$ for $i = 1, 2$.
	
	Hence, we have
	\begin{prooftree}
	  \hypo{\vdash S\{(A_1 \vee A_2) \vee (A_1 \vee A_2)\}}
	  \infer1[$\equiv$]{\vdash S\{(A_1 \vee A_1) \vee (A_2 \vee A_2)\}}

	\end{prooftree}
  \item If $A = A_1 \wedge A_2$, then by the induction hypothesis, we have 
$\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\{\acD, \me, \mee, \meee\}}{A_i}
	      {\vlhy {A_i \vee A_i}}}$ for $i = 1, 2$.

 	Hence, we have
	\begin{prooftree}
	  \hypo{\vdash S\{(A_1 \wedge A_2) \vee (A_1 \wedge A_2)\}}
	  \infer1[$\me$]{\vdash S\{(A_1 \vee A_1) \wedge (A_2 \vee A_2)\}}

		   {\vdash S\{A_1 \wedge A_2\}}
	\end{prooftree}
  \item If $A = \exists x A'$, then by the induction hypothesis, we have $\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\{\acD, \me, \mee,
	\meee\}}{A'}{\vlhy {A' \vee A'}}}$.

	Hence, we have
	\begin{prooftree}
	  \hypo{\vdash S\{\exists x A' \vee \exists x A'\}}
 	  \infer1[$\mee$]{\vdash S\{\exists x (A' \vee A')\}}
	  \ellipsis{$\{\acD, \me, \mee, \meee\}$}
		   {\vdash S\{\exists x A'\}}
	\end{prooftree}
  \item If $A = \forall x A'$, then by the induction hypothesis, we have $\vlderivation{\vlde{}{\{\acD, \me, \mee,

	Hence, we have

	  \ellipsis{$\{\acD, \me, \mee, \meee\}$}
		   {\vdash S\{\forall x A'\}}
	\end{prooftree}

\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
The rules $\mee$ and $\meee$ are derivable for $\{\wD, \cD\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have:
\begin{center}
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\exists x A}
\infer1[$\equiv$]{\exists x (A \vee \fff)}
\infer1[$\wD$]{\exists x (A \vee B)}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{0.5cm}
and 
\hspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\exists x B}
\infer1[$\equiv$]{\exists x (\fff \vee B)}
\infer1[$\wD$]{\exists x (A \vee B)}
\end{prooftree}
\end{center}
Thus, we have:

\begin{center}
\begin{prooftree}
\hypo{\exists x A \vee \exists x B}
\ellipsis{}{\exists x (A \vee B) \vee \exists x (A \vee B)}
\infer1[$\cD$]{\exists x (A \vee B)}
\end{prooftree}
\end{center}
Similar for $\meee$.
\end{proof}

Now we define a propositional encoding for first-order formulas.

\begin{definition}
The propositional encoding $\PE{A}$ of a formula $A$ is defined inductively by:

\begin{centering}
	$\PE{a} = a$ for every atom $a$

	$\PE{(A \vee B)} = \PE{A} \vee \PE{B}$ \hspace{2cm} $\PE{(A \wedge B)} =
	\PE{A} \wedge \PE{B}$

	$\PE{(\forall x A)} = U_x \vee \PE{A}$ \hspace{2cm} $\PE{(\exists x A)}
	= E_x \wedge \PE{A}$

\end{centering}
where $U_x$ and $E_x$ are fresh nullary atoms.

\end{definition}

Similarly, we can define the propositional encoding $\PE{S}$ of a context $S$
inductively by setting $\PE{\Box} = \Box$. Note that $\PE{S}$ is also a context.

We have the following facts:

\begin{proposition}
For any context $S$ and any formula $A$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\PE{A}$ is a formula containing no quantifier for any formula $A$.
  \item $\Gr(\PE{A}) = \Gr(A)$ by confounding the atoms $U_x$, $E_x$ with the variable
	  $x$. Thus, a map $f : \Gr(\PE{A}) \rightarrow \Gr(\PE{B})$ can be seen as a map
		$f : \Gr(A) \rightarrow \Gr(B)$.
  \item $\PE{(S\{A\})} = \PE{S}\{\PE{A}\}$.
\end{itemize}

\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop311}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two formulas such that
$\od{\odd{\odh {A}}{}{B}{\{\wD, \cD\}}}$. Then 
$\od{\odd{\odh {\PE{A}}}{}{\PE{B}}{\{\wD, \cD\}}}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{mlem}
	Given two formulas $A$ and $B$ and a derivation $\od{\odd{\odh {A}}
	{\Delta}{B}{\{\wD, \cD\}}}$, then there exists a skew bifibration $G(A)
	\rightarrow G(B)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma_ctr}, there exists a derivation $\od{\odd{\odh {A}}
	{\Delta}{B}{\{\wD, \acD, \me, \mee, \meee \}}}$.
	
For each rule from $\{\wD, \acD, \me, \mee, \meee \}$, we define a map and show that it is a skew fibration.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\vdash S\{\fff \}}
  \infer1[$\wD$]{\vdash S\{A\}}
\end{prooftree}:

  the map $wk$ maps $\fff$ to anything and is identity elsewhere.   
  
  \item
    \begin{prooftree}
      \hypo{\vdash S\{a \vee a\}}
       \infer1[$\acD$]{\vdash S\{a\}} 
    \end{prooftree}: 
    
    the map $ac$ maps the two $a$-labelled literals in the premise to the $a$-labelled literal in the conclusion.

  \item 
    \begin{prooftree}
      \hypo{\vdash S\{(A \wedge B) \vee (C \wedge D)\}}
      \infer1[$\me$]{\vdash S\{(A \vee C) \wedge (B \vee D)\}}
    \end{prooftree}:
    
    the map $m$ is the canonical identity that maps $A$ to $A$, $\cdots$, $D$ to $D$.
  \item 
    \begin{prooftree}
      \hypo{\vdash S\{\exists x A \vee \exists x B\}}
      \infer1[$\mee$]{\vdash S\{\exists x (A \vee B)\}}
    \end{prooftree}: 
   
    the map $m_1$ maps the two $x$-labelled binders in the premise to the $x$-labelled binder in the conclusion,  $A$ to $A$ and $B$ to $B$.
  \item
    \begin{prooftree}
      \hypo{\vdash S\{\forall x A \vee \forall x B\}}
      \infer1[$\meee$]{\vdash S\{\forall x (A \vee B)\}}
    \end{prooftree}:
    
    the map $m_2$ maps the two $x$-labelled binders in the premise to the $x$-labelled binder in the conclusion,  $A$ to $A$ and $B$ to $B$. 

\end{itemize}

By considering propositional encodings, the maps defined are label-preserving skew fibrations on the underlying fographs according to \cite{Strassburger 2007}.

Now we prove that each map $g \in \{wk, ac, m, m_1, m_2 \}$ is a skew bifibration. To do that, it suffices to prove that $g$ is a fibration between the corresponding binding graphs since it is already a skew fibration on the corresponding fographs and it is label-preserving and existential-preserving.
\begin{center}
for each $x$-binder $b$ in $\Gr(\PE{B})$, for each vertex $v \in V(\Gr(\PE{A}))$
such that $g(v)$ is bound by $b$, there exists a unique binder $b'$ such
that $b'$ binds $v$.
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $wk$ and $m$ are clearly fibrations: the binding relations of the premise and the conclusion are exactly the same.
  \item $ac$ is a fibration: suppose that $a$ that in the conclusion $a$ is bound by some quantifier $b$ in $S$, then for each of its preimages by $ac$, there exists exactly one binder (in fact, $b$) in $S$ that binds it.
  \item $m_1$ and $m_2$ are fibrations: in the conclusion, for every atom $a$ in $A \vee B$ bound by the $x$-labelled quantifier, $a$ has exactly one preimage and it is bound by the $x$-llabelled quantifier in the premise.
\end{itemize}

  Therefore, all of these maps are skew bifibrations and since skew bifibrations
on fographs compose (Lemma 10.32, \cite{Hughes 2019}), there exists a skew
bifibration from $\Gr(A)$ to $\Gr(B)$.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem_}
If a formula $A$ is provable in $\LK$, then it has a combinatorial proof.
\end{theorem_}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem \ref{thm1}, there exists a formula $A'$ such that there is a proof
$\Pi$ of $A'$ in $\FOMLL$ and a derivation $D$ from $A'$ to $A$ consisting of
the $\wD$ and $\cD$ rules only. The proof $\Pi$ corresponds to a unique
unification net which is equivalent to the fonet corresponding to $\Pi$, i.e.,
the fograph $\Gr(A')$ together with the links of $\Pi$. By Lemma \ref{mlem}, 
there exists a skew bifibration $\Gr(A') \rightarrow \Gr(A)$. We have thus a
combinatorial proof of $A$.

\end{proof}

\subsection{From skew bifibrations to contraction/weakening}

\begin{theorem_}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two formulas and $f: G(A) \rightarrow G(B)$ a skew bifibration. Then there exists a derivation $\od{\odd{\odh {A}}{\Delta}{B}{\{\wD, \cD\}}}$.
\end{theorem_}

$f$ can be seen as a skew fibration from $G(\PE{A})$ to $G(\PE{B})$, which gives the existence of the propositions $A'$ and $B'$, and of the following derivation:
  \[\od{\odd{\odd{\odd{\odh{\PE{A}} }
  {\Delta }{A'}{\me} }
  {\Delta' }{B'}{\acD} }
  {\Delta''}{\PE{B}}{\wD}} \]

\begin{lemma} there exists $B''$ such that $\PE{B''}$ = $B'$.

\begin{proof}
Consider the dervation $\Delta''$. If some $U_x$ (or $E_x$) is introduced
via weakening, then all the atoms it binds in $\PE{B}$ should also be introduced 
via weakening. In fact, an atom of $\PE{B}$ is introduced via weakening is 
equivalent to the fact that its corresponding vertex is not in the image of $f$. 
Since there is an edge from $U_x$ (resp. $E_x$) to all the literals it binds in the 
binding graph $\overrightarrow{\Gr(B)}$, if one of the atoms is in the image, 
$U_x$ (resp. $E_x$) should also be in the image since $f$ is a fibration on binding graphs.

This means that a such $B''$ can be obtained from $B$ by erasing all the $U_x$ and $E_x$ introduced via weakening and all the atoms they bind.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We introduce new (atomic) symbols $E_x^*$ and $U_x^*$ which are used to
represent disjunctions of $E_x$ and $U_x$ respectiveley.

We define a translation $(\cdot)^*$ inductively by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(E_x \vee \cdots \vee E_x)* = E_x^*$
  \item $(U_x \vee \cdots \vee U_x)* = U_x^*$
  \item structural recursion in all the other cases.
\end{itemize}

Then the derivation:
 \[\od{\odd{\odd{\odh{\PE{A}} }
  {\Delta }{A'}{\me} }
  {\Delta' }{B'}{\acD}} \]
can be translated to the derivation:
\[\od{\odd{\odh{(\PE{A})^*} }
{\Delta^* }{(B')^*}{}} \]

where $\Delta^*$ is the derivation obtained by replacing all the formulas $F$
with $F^*$.

Note that we should also introduce new rules in the derivation $\Delta^*$.
Otherwise, the rule applications cannot work in general.

To do that, we define the following rule transformation:

\begin{center}
\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{Q_x^*}
  \infer1[$\acD$]{Q_x^*}
\end{prooftree}

$\leadsto$

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{Q_x^*}
  \infer1[$=$]{Q_x^*}
\end{prooftree}

}
\vspace{0.4cm}

\mbox{
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{(Q_x^* \wedge C) \vee (Q_x^* \wedge D)}
  \infer1[$\me$]{Q_x^* \wedge (C \vee D)}
\end{prooftree}

$\leadsto$

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{(Q_x^* \wedge C) \vee (Q_x^* \wedge D)}
  \infer1[$\me'$]{Q_x^* \wedge (C \vee D)}
\end{prooftree}

}
	
\end{center}
where $Q_x^*$ stands for $E_x^*$ or $U_x^*$.

$\Delta^*$ can now be transformed into a valid derivation $\Delta_1$ by using the two
transformation rules above and by applying them in a bottom-up style:
\[\od{\odd{\odh{(\PE{A})^*} }
{\Delta_1 }{(B')^*}{\acD, \me, \me'}} \]

\begin{lemma}
Every line of $\Delta_1$ is a propositional encoding (by
confounding $Q_x^*$ with $Q_x$).

\begin{proof}
We proceed by bottom-up induction in the derivation.
Clearly, $B'*$ is a propositional encoding as there is no disjunction of $Q_x$
in it.

First consider the $\acD$ rule:
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{C \vee C}
  \infer1[$\acD$]{C}
\end{prooftree}

It is clear that if $C$ is a propositional encoding, then so is $C \vee C$.

Now consider the $\me$ rule:
\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{(C \wedge D) \vee (E \wedge F)}
  \infer1[$\me$]{(C \vee E) \wedge (D \vee F)}
\end{prooftree}

Suppose that $(C \vee E) \wedge (D \vee F) = \PE{G}$ for some $G$.
Since $C \vee E$ cannot be $Q_x$ (otherwise, the rule applied would be
$\me'$), $G$ can be written as $G_1 \wedge G_2$ with $C \vee E = \PE{G_1}$ and $D
\vee F = \PE{G_2}$.

We have thus $G_i = \forall x_i H_i$ or $J_i \vee K_i (i = 1, 2)$.

If $G_i = \forall x H_i$ for some $i$, then there will be a conjunction of $U_x^*$
and some formula which can never be eliminated by the rules $\me$, $\me'$ and
$\acD$. However, there exists no such conjunction in ${\PE{A}}^*$, which leads to a
contradiction.

Hence, $G_i$ can be written as $J_i \vee K_i$ for $i = 1, 2$. We now have $(C
\wedge D) \vee (E \wedge F) = \PE{((J_1 \wedge J_2) \vee (K_1 \wedge
K_2))}$.

Finally, consider the $\me'$ rule:

\begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{(Q_x^* \wedge C) \vee (Q_x^* \wedge D)}
  \infer1[$\me'$]{Q_x^* \wedge (C \vee D)}
\end{prooftree}

Suppose that $Q_X^* \wedge (C \vee D)$ = $\PE{F}$ for some $F$. It is clear
that $Q_x^* = E_x^*$ and $F = \exists x G$ with $\PE{G} = C \vee D$ for some $G$.
We distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $G = \forall y H$: in this case, $(Q_x^* \wedge C) \vee (Q_x^* \wedge
D)$ has a subformula $(E_x^* \wedge U_y^*)$, which cannot be eliminated by the
	rules $\me$, $\me'$, $\acD$. It is clear that ${\PE{A}}^*$ does not
have a subformula of this form, which leads to a contradiction.
  \item $G = G_1 \vee G_2$: in this case, $(Q_x^* \wedge C) \vee (Q_x^* \wedge
  D) = \PE{((\exists x G_1) \vee (\exists x G_2))}$.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

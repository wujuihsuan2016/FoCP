----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------
More detailed comments:

I think it should be stressed early (as early as in the abstract) that the paper is about FO without the equality predicate,
since it is usually considered in standard proof systems.

p.3, left: The notion of colored graphs here does not require adjacent vertices to have different colors, but the one in [18] does.
Is there a mistake here, since the one in [18] requires different colors?

-> There is no mistake. The requirement mentioned here is never used in the
paper.

p.3, right: I suppose for fographs it is possible that different vertices have the same label?
I also find the definition of fographs a bit confusing, since it starts with abstract graph theoretic properties of fographs,
before presenting the construction of fographs from formulas.
I suggest to reverse it, by first presenting the construction of fographs (from formulas) before enumerating all the properties of fographs.
In fact, this is how forgraphs are presented in [18].

->

p3,right: What about the atoms True and False in the fographs?
They are part of the definition of FO formulas, but are they really needed?
Almost all results in the paper require that False does not appear in the proof.
Maybe they can be omitted.

-> The atoms True and False are needed for establishing the equivalence between KS1 and MLS1*.
(TO CHECK)

p.4, left: The notion of "dual" is not defined yet.
Again, it is already defined nicely in [18].
I also suggest to present here some intuitive explanation on how fonets represent proofs.
The same for the other notions here such as links, leaps, (bi)fibration, skew (bi)fibration, and their relations with derivations in KS1 and LK1.
Figures 4 and 5 can be easily expand to provide intuitive explanation.

-> Yes, the notion of duality is implicitly suggested by the notation
\overline{p}.

p.6, Theorem 19: I think it is safe to assume that formulas are rectified, thus, there is no need for \hat{A} here.
Otherwise, there will be too many notations to remember here.

-> 

p.7, Lemma 22: \overline{S{A}} is not defined yet.
I assume it is the complement of the corresponding formula for S{A}?

-> Yes, it is.

p.10, right: A\cdot here is just "variable renaming"?

-> We use this notation to simplify the rectified version of rules for
quantifiers. Variable renaming is a more general notion as it allows rename more
than one variable.

p.10, left: Why "resource management" in the title of Sect. IX?

-> Like combinatorial proofs for propositional logic, the skew bifibration part
corresponds to the linear part of the sequent proof. That's why we mention
resource management in the title though it is not explicitly discussed in the
paper.

p.11, right: on full fograph homomorphism.
There is something missing here since the homomorphism is not necessarily injective?
Or, it is meant to be "strong" homomorphism?

-> The notion of fullness is well defined in category theory and that is exactly
what we need here.

Minor comments for the author(s):
- Lemma 30: you cite [35] for the proof of this lemma, but as far as I know [35] does not discuss first-order quantifiers. I can see a possibility of quantifiers interferring with the atomic interaction rule. For example,

(forall x. A) \/ B
-------------------
forall x.(A \/ B)
---------------------------------
forall x.(A \/ (px \/ ~px) /\ B))

where x is vacuous in B. It doesn't seem straightforward that ai can be permuted directly above structural equivalence.
